Safe ordinals gallery is an AI-Powered App for images inscribed on the Decentralized Bitcoin blockchain. Ordinals protocol enable users to send and receive Satoshis (smallest monetary unit of a Bitcoin) that encapusulate data to them. This data can be in the form of text, images, audio etc.  

## Description

Ordinals best features are immutability and censorship resistance. Unfortunately not all images are safe for the work place or third party platform. Only days after the launch of the Bitcoin based Ordinals protocol, its creator had to deal with their first shock pornographic image, which has been inscribed into the blockchain. Safe ordinals gallery aims to automate the process of eliminating the following materials. 
- `porn` - pornography images
- `hentai` - hentai images, but also includes pornographic drawings
- `sexy` - sexually explicit images, but not pornography. Think nude photos, playboy, bikini, etc.
- `drawings` - safe for work drawings (including anime)
- `words` - optical character recognition(OCR) of words safe to use at work
- - obscenity, profanity, & vulgar speech

To get a first impression, you are welcome to play with our [public demo](https://).
